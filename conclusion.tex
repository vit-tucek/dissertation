We have constructed a nontrivial differential operator of finite order acting between sections of bundles associated to one-dimensional representations whose geometric weights are precisely those for the Yamabe operator. From the classification of conformally invariant differential operators it follows that this operator must be the Yamabe operator. % In particular, from the values of the geometric weights it follows that the projection from $\Lambda^1\lie{p}_+\otimes\overline{L(\lambda)}$ onto $H_1(\lie{p}_+,\overline{L(\lambda)})$ must be into the subspace $\lie{p}_+\otimes S^1(\lie{p}_+)\otimes F(\lambda)$. It is a straightforward computation to check that the resulting operator is the Yamabe operator.

The BGG constructions of Calderbank and Diemer works for formal globalizations of all unitarizable modules of highest weight. Whether the construction works for some non-formal globalization (such as minimal or smooth) is under current investigation by the author.
