@article{orsted_geometry_2009,
	abstract = {Let {\$G\_0\$} be a connected, simply connected real simple Lie group. Suppose that {\$G\_0\$} has a compact Cartan subgroup {\$T\_0\$}, so it has discrete series representations. Relative to {\$T\_0\$} there is a distinguished positive root system {\${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}+\$} for which there is a unique noncompact simple root \${\textbackslash}nu\$, the {"Borel} -- de Siebenthal system". There is a lot of fascinating geometry associated to the corresponding {"Borel} -- de Siebenthal discrete series" representations of {\$G\_0\$.} In this paper we explore some of those geometric aspects and we work out the {\$K\_0\$--spectra} of the Borel -- de Siebenthal discrete series representations. This has already been carried out in detail for the case where the associated symmetric space {\$G\_0/K\_0\$} is of hermitian type, i.e. where \${\textbackslash}nu\$ has coefficient 1 in the maximal root \${\textbackslash}mu\$, so we assume that the group {\$G\_0\$} is not of hermitian type, in 
other words that \${\textbackslash}nu\$ has coefficient 2 in \${\textbackslash}mu\$. {\textbackslash}medskip Several authors have studied the case where {\$G\_0/K\_0\$} is a quaternionic symmetric space and the inducing holomorphic vector bundle is a line bundle. That is the case where \${\textbackslash}mu\$ is orthogonal to the compact simple roots and the inducing representation is 1--dimensional.},

By functoriality of the constructions, we obtain different models of the unitary representation, as well as giving new proofs of unitarity and irreducibility.

The group O(p,q) acts as the M{\"o}bius group of conformal transformations on Rp−1,q−1, and preserves a space of solutions of the ultrahyperbolic Laplace equation on Rp−1,q−1. We construct in an intrinsic and natural way a Hilbert space of solutions so that O(p,q) becomes a continuous irreducible unitary representation in this Hilbert space.

@article{cap_projective_2010,
	abstract = "For curved projective manifolds we introduce a notion of a normal tractor frame field, based around any point. This leads to canonical systems of (redundant) coordinates that generalise the usual homogeneous coordinates on projective space. These give preferred local maps to the model projective space that encode geometric contact with the model to a level that is optimal, in a suitable sense. In terms of the trivialisations arising from the special frames, normal solutions of classes of natural linear {PDE} (so-called first {BGG} equations) are shown to be necessarily polynomial in the generalised homogeneous coordinates; the polynomial system is the pull back of a polynomial system that solves the corresponding problem on the model. Thus questions concerning the zero locus of solutions, as well as related finer geometric and smooth data, are reduced to a study of the corresponding polynomial systems and algebraic sets. We show that a normal solution determines a canonical manifold 
stratification that reflects an orbit decomposition of the model. Applications include the construction of structures that are analogues of {Poincare-Einstein} manifolds.",
